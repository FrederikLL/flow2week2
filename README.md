Flow 2 week 2 Assignments

Day 1:

This seems to just be a js file. Should work fine. Not sure why it didnt come out as a project though(?). Didnt use cloned startcode for this i guess.
I didn't get super far with this assignment, and some of the 4's and 5's i got from class.

Day 2:

Didnt complete joke and errorhandling assignments in this one. Rest of it is completed,

testing get,post,put,delete
Test Post:
age 2: status code 400, age must be >= 3 and <= 99
name ib: status code 400, name must include at least 2 characters. ( ib is only 2 characters?)
gender mand: status code 400, Gender must contain 'male' or 'female'
illegal email: status code 400, invalid email

PUT also works

DELETE also works

Day 3:
Front-end is in the CORSHOST folder and backend is in the other folder. I've succesfully deployed both, the VSCode using surge.
I did run into a problem of after the deployment with surge to my domain i seem unable to login to my manager page.


Day 4:

No friday
